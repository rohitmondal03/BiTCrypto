        <h1>What is crypto ?</h1>
        <p> Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual coin secured by cryptography, which makes it next to impossible to counterfeit. They have their own store values, and are designed to use as a medium of exchange for buying goods or services. Cryptocurrencies are decentralised, meaning that no authority regulates them. They are built on the blockchain network technology, which ensures transparency and helps track every transaction.</p>

        <h1>How do cryptocurrencies work?</h1>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. They are tokens that can be used as a form of payment in exchange for online goods and services. They carry a pre-determined store value of their own, just like any other fiat currency like the US dollar or the Indian rupee. Cryptocurrencies are digitally mined, where very sophisticated computers solve extremely complex computational mathematics problems. Their mining is painstaking, costly and only sporadically rewarding.</p>

        <h1>How to invest in cryptocurrency?</h1>
        <p>Itâ€™s not a very difficult task to invest in cryptocurrency, thanks to the easy access available to crypto exchanges and deep penetration of the internet and smartphones. Technology has eased the access to digital currencies for potential investors. To invest in cryptocurrencies, investors need to first do some homework for choosing the right cryptocurrency and crypto exchange. One can buy these currencies using their home currencies, or US dollars, from his/her preferred exchange. However, there are some currencies that accept investment only in Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies.</p>

        <h1>Can cryptocurrencies be used to make online purchases?</h1>
        <p>Yes, cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange, which can be used to make payments for online purchases. There are hundreds of online shops and retailers that accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, there is a catch. Both the buyer and seller should agree to accept the particular cryptocurrency for the deal. There are various search engines to find the goods and services that can be purchased using cryptocurrencies.</p>
